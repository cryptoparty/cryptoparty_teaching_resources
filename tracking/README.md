# What is this?

This is two screenshots from an addon-on called [Lightbeam](https://myshadow.org/lightbeam). The first one shows the connection between web pages from someone's browsing history and how they can be connected through web tracking. Combined this tells tracking companies a lot more about a person compared to not being able to make these connections.

# How to use it?

These two screenshots can be used to show the difference between a default Firefox browser and one with some extra settings and anti-tracking and ad-blocking add-ons. The main point is that there is a big difference (hence no details are provided what settings and add-ons have been used).

It can happen that the mood in a "How the Internet works & Browsing" session goes down and down and down the more you talk with your group about how things work and what's possible. At some point things typically improve a lot once we finally introduce counter measures and maybe even start talking about the Tor Browser.
Showing these screenshots early in the "How the Internet works & Browsing" session can help to mitigate the sometimes rather depressed mood described above.
